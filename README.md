# Net Ninja's Material UI Tutorial Updated

This project is based on the [Net Ninja Material UI tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KEpWHtG10M&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gjxLvV4VEkZ6H6H4yWuS58&ab_channel=NetNinja)

## Differences

- Created the project in vite using yarn with `yarn create vite <project> --template react-swc-ts`. This creates a new React project using TypeScript.
- Used Material UI v5.
- Used Tanstack Query v5 for state management and querying.
- Used react-hook-form v7 for creating a new note.

_This is not an absolutely ideal layout of the project and way to implement but I wanted to provide this as an update to those who are/were curious._
